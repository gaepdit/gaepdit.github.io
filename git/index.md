## .gitignore files

Use these links to generate global .gitignore files. These files should be added to your user directory (`%userprofile%` on Windows) and must be named `.gitignore` (with no other extension).

## Tips

You can add shortcuts (called aliases) for commands that you use frequently. Here are some [useful Git aliases](https://gist.github.com/dougwaldron/3b447eca31d4ef3ca6cef1d6a1c8fc67) to get you started.

Type `git config --edit --global` to open and edit the `.gitconfig` file.
